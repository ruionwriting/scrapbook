# Dave Learns Docker

This is a simple game that I've prepared to play with my team. The goal is simple to all of us to explore our knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose, get better understanding and explore the small details.

> For each lesson just open a new terminal sessions on each lesson folder. Remember to have Docker running :D

## V1

`v1` is into play: Docker Compose and environment variables.

* [Lesson 1: Compose files naming matter](lesson1/README.md)
* [Lesson 2: Environment variables, here we go](lesson2/README.md)
* [Lesson 3: I don't know Docker](lesson2/README.md)
